# ML Algorithms from Scratch

Welcome to the **ML Algorithms from Scratch** repository! This project aims to implement various artificial intelligence algorithms in C++, providing a hands-on approach to understanding AI concepts.

## Introduction

This repository is the result of my learning journey through MIT and Stanford online courses. Here, you'll find implementations of fundamental AI algorithms designed to deepen your understanding of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science.

## Algorithms Implemented

The following algorithms are currently implemented in this repository:

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**
  - Gradient Descent
  - Decision Tree Classifier

Feel free to suggest more algorithms you'd like to see implemented!

## Acknowledgments
A huge thanks to the instructors from **MIT** and **Stanford** for their outstanding courses available on YouTube. Their teachings have been invaluable in my learning journey and have greatly inspired this project.
